Videos encompass extensive metadata, such as frame count, resolution (height/width), time base, duration, pixel format, bit rate, codec name, and profile, among others. However, incorporating all such metadata into the Video data type is impractical from a memory efficiency standpoint. Instead, we prioritize including only essential metadata fields—specifically frame count, height, width, and FPS. Additional metadata can be dynamically retrieved during video processing as needed.\n",

The idea behind the \"File\" type was to start with a wrapper of the appropriate python file-like protocols, then to further type into VideoFile, AudioFile, PdfFile, etc. — each of which having their own domain-specific methods such a read_frames, read_channels, read_pages etc. respectively.
